# A textbased adventure

**About**
My super chaotic first ever javascript project. An epic adventure set in the far away land of Wisteria, where a big wedding is about the begin... Sadly I 
haven't had the time to clean up the code or finish the story. Right now the only thing you can do is spend some money, get drunk, and die if you go to a bar. 
So it's kind of like a 2020 simulator.

This textbased adventure is based on homebrewed DnD adventure me and my friend Oliver dreamed up in highschool. Much like this website the campaign
never left the worktable, and the world may never know if the party managed to escape the castle trough a wedding cake or not. Hit me up to be your companys
next DM/Tiefling bard.

**Process**
The project lasted around 2 weeks, with some small adons afterwards as well. I started by watching a tutorial by webdevsimplified where he made a textbased adventure of his own. In the beginning it was an exact copy of his code. I then started to changes things around (for better and for worse). The biggest change I made was the add an input for the player to add their own name. This was saved in a variable, and accessed on the welcome screen. 

**Improvment**
This is a beginners project, and I honestly think everything could be improved.
